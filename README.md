# Indoor Running Distance Calibrator

Tired of getting the wrong distance on indoor runs at Strava. This code can take a .tcx file as input and calibrate the distance to the correct distance. When using a Garmin watch, you can download the .tcx file from https://connect.garmin.com/. Further on, you run this code to calibrate the distance. Then, you can upload it to Strava and delete the original activity with the wrong distance.
